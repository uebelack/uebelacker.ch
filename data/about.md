I'm a full-stack developer and software architect with 20+ years of experience in web and mobile application development. Passionate about coding, problem solving and modern technologies.

My fascination with computers started early on. When I was 12 years old, I reset my father's computer out of curiosity because I wanted to know what happens when you enter format c:. Only a few years later I created my first own homepage with pure HTML.

Now, I look back on 20 years of experience in web-based application development. I started with PHP and then worked my way through Java-based development from servlets to JSP and Java Server Faces to Spring Boot and Angular.js. During this time I learned a lot about good web design and excellent user experience, which I can now rely on every day.

For the last 6 years, I've been working for a large Swiss industrial company as technical lead for the implementation of the digitalization strategy with several IIoT services where I gained a lot of experience with React, React Native, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, DevOps and cloud based solutions.

One of my strengths is that Iâ€™m very quick to get to grips with new topics and technologies, so I can easily adapt to ongoing projects or kick-off new ones from scratch. I believe in building quality from day one. Topics like clean code, secure coding, test driven development and a good user experience are central to my work.

I will be working as a freelancer from January 2023 on and am currently looking for my first exciting project.
